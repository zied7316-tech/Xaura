# ✅ Super Admin Password Fixed!

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong**

The Super Admin account had an incorrect password hash. I've just deleted the old account and created a fresh one with the correct password.

## 🚀 **Try Again NOW!**

### **Test Page:**
Go back to the test page (`test-login.html`) and click **"Test Login"** again.

**You should now see:** ✅ **LOGIN SUCCESSFUL!**

---

### **Real Login:**
Once the test works, go to the actual login page:
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

**Enter:**
```
📧 Email:    admin@xaura.com
🔑 Password: SuperAdmin123!
```

**Click "Sign In"**

---

## 🎯 **It Should Work Now!**

The password has been correctly hashed and stored in the database.

**Important Notes:**
- Capital **S** in Super
- Capital **A** in Admin
- Number **123**
- Exclamation mark **!** at the end

---

## ✅ **Verification**

If the test page shows:
```
✅ LOGIN SUCCESSFUL!
Name: Xaura Admin
Email: admin@xaura.com
Role: SuperAdmin
```

Then the backend is working, and the real login page should work too!

**Go ahead and test it now!** 🎊
